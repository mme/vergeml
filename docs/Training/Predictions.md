Its time to put the AI into use!
============

Predictions, or inference, is the term used when an AI uses its capabilities learned during deep learning training. So in order to infere, an AI must have been trained before. 

To start predicting a singular file we need to adress the trained AI using its name by typing: 

    ml @<AI-name> predict <file>

To predict multiple files just direct to the directory and type

    ml @<AI-name> predict <path/*>

You could include the following options 
* --top=n
